Dice Rolling Simulator

This Python script simulates rolling two six-sided dice. It allows users to roll the dice repeatedly and generates random values for each roll.

Features

Rolls two six-sided dice and displays their values.
Allows users to roll the dice multiple times.
Simple and interactive command-line interface.

How to Use

Prerequisites: Ensure Python is installed on your system (version 3.x or later).
Run the Script:
Copy the code into a Python file
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the script using the command:
Interact with the Script:
The script will prompt you with: "Roll the Dices Again?".
Enter "yes" or "y" to roll again.
Enter anything else to exit the program.

Code Explanation

The script uses the random module to generate random integers between 1 and 6, simulating dice rolls. Here's how it works:

Initial Setup:

Defines the range of dice values (1 to 6).
Initializes a loop condition variable (roll_again).

Main Loop:

Simulates rolling the dice and prints their values.
Prompts the user for input to decide whether to roll again.
Exits the loop if the user inputs anything other than "yes" or "y".

Customization Ideas

Add support for more dice.
Allow the user to specify the number of sides on each die.
Add graphical representations of the dice.
